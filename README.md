# CROSSING THE NILE

***"Outplay and Outhink"***   
Prepare for an adventure of limitless possibilities as you dodge obstacles, battle opponents, and explore the ever-changing Nile.   
Crossing the Nile is a highly competitive, fast paced  game designed for those who crave a hard fought victory.   
Cross the river, dodge the obstacles and become a Legend.

## *Setting*
The playing arena is the Nile with logs floating on it. There are 2 demons, trying to cross the river. 2 champions have to guide them each safely across, avoiding the crocodiles, bull-sharks, snakes and scorpions. To avoid camping, the log is so thin that the demon is not safe on it.

## *Gameplay*
The demon is guided using the arrow keys.   
Crossing obstacles accrues points for the champion. Moving ones give 10 points, while fixed one give 5 points, with an additional level bonus.   
Level bonus is calculated by *(level - 1) / 2 * Points* (Leaving out Time Penalty)   
Time penalty is a decrease of 0.5 points every half a second.   
If any of the demons succeed in reaching the other bank, the speed of moving obstacles increases.   
For increased difficulty, the moving obstacles reverse their direction randomly once in a while.
